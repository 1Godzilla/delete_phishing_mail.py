Python Delete Phishing Mail

A Python-based tool to detect and delete phishing emails from an inbox. This tool helps enhance email security by identifying potentially dangerous emails and removing them to prevent accidental clicks or responses.

Disclaimer: This tool is for educational purposes and authorized testing only. It should be used responsibly and with permission on systems you have the right to access.

Features

	•	Keyword-Based Detection: Scans emails for phishing-related keywords (e.g., “urgent”, “reset password”, “account locked”).
	•	Suspicious Sender Detection: Flags emails from unverified or unknown senders.
	•	Automated Deletion: Deletes detected phishing emails or optionally moves them to the junk/spam folder.
	•	Customizable: Allows you to adjust keyword criteria and add specific senders or domains to a blacklist.

Requirements

	•	Python 3.x
	•	IMAP Library: To access email inboxes (e.g., imaplib, which is part of Python’s standard library)
	•	Email and re Libraries: To parse emails and identify patterns (also included in Python’s standard library)

Setup

	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/delete_phishing_mail.git


	2.	Navigate to the Project Directory:

cd delete_phishing_mail


	3.	Install Dependencies:
If your tool requires any external libraries not included in Python’s standard library, install them:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Create a requirements.txt file if any additional libraries are required.)

Configuration

	1.	Set Up Email Access:
	•	Update the script with your email provider’s IMAP server settings.
	•	Enter your email credentials securely, or consider using environment variables for storing sensitive information.
	2.	Customize Detection Criteria:
	•	Modify phishing-related keywords in the script to improve detection accuracy.
	•	Add specific domains or email addresses to a blacklist to automatically flag known phishing sources.

Usage

	1.	Run the Tool:

python delete_phishing_mail.py


	2.	Follow Prompts:
	•	The tool will connect to your inbox, scan for emails that match phishing criteria, and display detected messages.
	•	You will be prompted to confirm if the tool should delete or move each detected email.

Example

Connecting to your email inbox...

	•	Testing: It’s recommended to test this tool on non-critical email accounts first to avoid accidental deletion of legitimate emails.

Project Structure

	•	delete_phishing_mail.py: Main script to connect to an email account, scan for phishing emails, and delete or move flagged messages.
	•	config.py (optional): Stores configuration settings like IMAP server details and email credentials securely.
